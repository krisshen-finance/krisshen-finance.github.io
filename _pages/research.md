## Publications

1. **[Are there too few publicly listed firms in the US?](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fire.12439)**  
with Craig Doidge, George Andrew Karolyi, and René M. Stulz, *Financial Review*, 2025, 60, 317–329.

   **Abstract:** Doidge, Karolyi, and Stulz (2017) show that from 1999 to 2012, the US develops a listing gap relative to other countries, meaning that it has abnormally few publicly listed firms. In this paper, we update their evidence to 2023 and find that the listing gap increases, but at a low rate. By 2023, the US has about half as many listed firms per capita as other developed countries. We discuss some of the important questions raised by the existence and increase of the listing gap to which we hope researchers will find answers.

## Work in Progress

1. **Artificial Intelligence, Opportunity, and Regulatory Uncertainty: Implications for Asset Pricing** 

   **Abstract:** This paper studies two channels—opportunity and regulatory uncertainty—through which
Artificial Intelligence (AI) affects the stock prices and risk premia. On the one hand, advances
in AI present firms with opportunities, leading them to exhibit characteristics of growth
firms and earn lower expected returns. On the other hand, firms face increased regulatory
uncertainty in AI development, increasing their political risk exposure and resulting in higher
expected returns. Using conference call transcripts, I construct a firm-level measure of AI
Exposure that captures the level of attention analysts and managers devote to AI-related
topics at specific points in time. Empirically and theoretically, I show that these two channels
exert opposing effects: firms focused on opportunity earn a negative AI risk premium, while
those more affected by regulatory uncertainty earn a positive AI risk premium.
